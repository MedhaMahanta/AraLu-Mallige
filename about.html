		AraLu Mallige Magazine is a quarterly distributed informational newspaper/magazine, only available in electronic medium. The magazine is completely run by students: older students are on the editorial board, and all Kannada Kali students can participate in submitting original magazine content. Adult mentors support us if and when requested to do so. Please see our team members <a href = "team.html"> here</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
		Our initiative was conceived to provide the younger generation another opportunity to hone their Kannada language, public speaking, and writing skills. In addition, the magazine involves our youth in our community cultural events and helps them learn about our language and culture.
		<br>
		<br>
		There are several Kannada publications; how is this any different?
		<br>
		Most publications are headed and run by adults, so content is selected and not student tested and approved. Other publications are theme based (generally based on India and Karnataka) and their content scope is limited to the theme. Our magazine is focused on community events, local affairs, or anything students would like to share with their Kannada Kali community! We are also offering students an opportunity to participate in the medium of their choice - blog, video, drawing, etc.
